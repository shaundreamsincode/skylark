## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd skylark
   ```

2. Set up your Rails master key (for production):
   ```bash
   # Copy your master key to an environment variable
   export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your_master_key_here
   ```

3. Start the application with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   # For development
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   
   # For production
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd skylark
   ```

2. Install Ruby dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed  # Optional: Populate with sample data
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ./bin/dev
   ```

## Development

- Run tests:
  ```bash
  rails test
  ```

- Start the Rails console:
  ```bash
  rails console
  ```

- Start the development server:
  ```bash
  ./bin/dev
  ```

## Docker Commands

- Build and start all services:
  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  ```

- Start services in background:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```

- View logs:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f web
  ```

- Run Rails commands in container:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec web rails console
  docker compose exec web rails db:migrate
  docker compose exec web rails db:seed  # Manually seed database
  ```

- Stop all services:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

- Clean up volumes:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  ```

## Database Seeding

The application includes comprehensive seed data to help you get started quickly. The seeding behavior is controlled by environment variables:

### Automatic Seeding (Docker)

When using Docker, seeding happens automatically based on your configuration:

- **Development**: Seeds automatically on container start
- **Production**: Use environment variables to control seeding:
  ```bash
  # Always seed (good for staging/demo environments)
  SEED_DATABASE=true
  
  # Only seed if database is empty (smart for production)
  SEED_DATABASE=if_empty
  
  # Force seed (explicit override)
  SEED_DATABASE=force
  ```

### Manual Seeding

To manually seed the database:

```bash
# Local development
rails db:seed

# Docker container
docker compose exec web rails db:seed
```

### CSS Development

For CSS development in Docker:

```bash
# Build CSS manually when needed
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web ./bin/build-css

# Or rebuild CSS from outside the container
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web bundle exec rails tailwindcss:build
```

**Note**: CSS is automatically built when the container starts in development mode.

### Seed Data Includes

- **Users**: Admin user and sample users with realistic profiles
- **Organizations**: Sample organizations with descriptions
- **Tags & Categories**: Comprehensive tagging system
- **Projects**: Sample projects with realistic content
- **Memberships**: User-organization relationships

### Safe to Run Multiple Times

The seed file uses `find_or_create_by!` methods, which means:
- ‚úÖ **No duplicate records**: Won't create duplicates if records already exist
- ‚úÖ **No data loss**: Won't destroy or overwrite existing data
- ‚úÖ **Safe for production**: Can be run safely in any environment
- ‚úÖ **Idempotent**: Running multiple times has the same effect as running once

This makes it safe to run the seed file repeatedly without worrying about data integrity issues.

### Default Admin Account

The seeding creates a default admin account:
- **Email**: admin@skylark.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: Super Admin

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Change the default admin password in production!

## Deployment
